# About testcases

By now, all testcases are from course lab.

## Correctness check

There are 2 directories of testcases, with standard output and ready-made script for auto test. But the script has different requirements, the following table shows what our compiler should do to satisfy the requirements. So some additional modify is needed.

| which    | script assert  |
| -------- | -------------- |
| 3-ir-gen | compile to IR  |
| 5-bonus  | complie to asm |
